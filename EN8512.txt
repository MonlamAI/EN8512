             Garden Sweet Smells

                          

                         

I was walking down a little path
Pink roses on either side
Garden sweet smells pass
It filled up my insides



 I’m just waiting for my true love to come
To hear her voice, it is like white bells
Her sisters came, they said she’s coming soon
Where will we go?
I don’t know, I’ll just follow her



Brick walls and bird songs
Gladness fills the air
Springtime dances pure and strong
And all’s lovely and fair



 I’m just waiting for my true love to come
To hear her voice, it is like white bells
Her sisters came, they said she’s coming soon
Where will we go?
I don’t know, I’ll just follow her



I noticed a feeling from inside
A novel form of joy
Crisp like crystal ocean tide
Each moment is glory



I’m just waiting for my true love to come
To hear her voice, it is like white bells
Her sisters came, they said she’s coming soon
Where will we go?
I don’t know, I’ll just follow her
